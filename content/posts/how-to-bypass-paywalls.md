Don't feel bad because you bypass paywalls, they effectively create a system where quality, fact-checked information is only accessible to "wealthy subscribers", while low-quality, "fake-newsy" media is usually free. Instead, support independant press.  

The best way I've found to bypass paywalls is to use the web archive tool [archive.today](https://archive.today/).

I'm not exactly sure how they work but if you want to know more you can read this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1bweixi/eli5_whyhow_do_archive_websites_bypass_paywalls/).

To use it, simply copy-paste the paywalled article URL into the "I want to search the archive for saved snapshots" search box. Then click on a snapshot and you're good to go!

# Welcome to the blug

"What is the blug ?" you may ask. Simple, it's a blog, with bugs. 

In this blog you will find stuff about me, my findings, my interests....

This is a test of using prose to edit my page.

```rust
let banana = "This is just of test of syntax highlighting";
fn toto(lol: u64) -> u64 {
    lol*4
}
```
